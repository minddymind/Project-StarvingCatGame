## 🐾 Character Rundown:

- **Brown Dog**: A sneaky and unpredictable foe, watch out as it tries to corner you.

## 🍴 The Food:

## 📈 Score and Level Progression:
Your score is the key to progressing through the game. Each level has a **different score threshold** that you must reach in order to advance.
